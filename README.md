# Getting And Cleaning Data: Project Assignment 1 
John Hopkins University

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

There are 5 steps to the project assignment including:

# ** Before you begin download and unzip the data file referenced above to your working directory **

1. This sectoon of the code will merge the training and the test sets in the downloaded zip file to create one combined data set (read the file and combine the file).
2. This section of the code will extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. This section of the code uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. This section of the code will labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Lastly, this section of code will reference the data set in step 4 and will create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# ** The code is saved as a run_analysis.R in the main directory **
